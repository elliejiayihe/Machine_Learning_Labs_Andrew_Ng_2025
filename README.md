Machine Learning Labs – Andrew Ng (2025)

This repository contains my lab work for the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng.

Certificate of Completion: https://coursera.org/share/7d27cc83fce6700f17cfdb07e1382da0

The specialization introduces the foundations of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, neural networks, deep learning, and practical applications. Through hands-on programming assignments, I implemented core ML algorithms and learned how to apply them to real-world data.

* Note: These notebooks are course labs. The exercises were partially pre-written by the course instructors. My role was to complete the essential code sections (functions, models, calculations) rather than writing the full notebook from scratch.

Course Labs Overview
Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning – Regression and Classification

C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb
Implemented linear regression with gradient descent. Learned how to minimize cost functions and fit continuous data.

C1_W3_Logistic_Regression.ipynb

Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms

C2_W1_Neural_Networks_Binary.ipynb
Built a simple neural network for binary classification. Learned forward propagation, activation functions, and backpropagation.

C2_W2_Neural_Networks_Classifications.ipynb
Extended neural networks to multi-class classification problems. Practiced one-hot encoding and softmax activation.

C2_W3_Applying_Machine_Learning.ipynb
Focused on practical aspects of ML: feature scaling, data preprocessing, and avoiding underfitting/overfitting.

C2_W4_Decision_Tree_with_Markdown.ipynb
Implemented decision trees for classification. Learned about splitting criteria, information gain, and tree interpretation.
